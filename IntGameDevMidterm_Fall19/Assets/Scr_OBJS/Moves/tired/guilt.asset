  - Y'know I would've been able to get through this if you were around.
  - I wish you would hang out with us more. Makes me pretty sad.
  - I'm sorry I hurt you, but I couldn't stop myself.
  - Y'know if you feel this isn't going to work out we can just go our separate ways.
  - Did what I say <b>really</> hurt you?
  - I think you're just too sensitive.
  - Is there anything actually wrong? I think everything's just fine.
  - I won't hurt you this time I promise. I'm sorry I left.
  - I didn't mean what I said! It was a joke!
  - You? Leaving me? Fine. Whatever.
